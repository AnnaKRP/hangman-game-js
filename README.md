# Hangman Game

The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, part of a "hangman" figure is drawn. If you guess the word before the figure is fully drawn, you win! If the figure is fully drawn before you can guess the word, you lose.
